#Working on alma (take care with your own systems!!)

#Start a root session
sudo -i

#List the SELinux metadata
ls -Z /etc/shadow

#List the SELinux metadata
ps -Z

#List the SELinux metadata
ls -Zd .

#Change the context (if you do not have a test system don't do it)
chcon -t admin_home_t /etc/shadow

#This will not work anymore
chage -l vagrant

#What about the logs
ausearch -m avc -ts recent

grep sealert /var/log/messages

#Infos from the sealert (in this case not a valid solution)
sealert -l <alert-id>

#Restore the context
restorecon -v /etc/shadow

#Now it works
chage -l vagrant




In the main, SELinux works with soething called type enforcment. The SELinux type of a source must be
compatible with the target SELinux type. If we need to customize content or if we make erroneous changes,
operations may not work.

In the main the targeted SELinux policy works with the context of processes, ports and files.
The option -Z displays the context with most tools. Processes need to be authorized to access
resources such as ports and files

The /etc/shadow file is a critical system file. Processes can only access this is the correct
context is set on the file and matches rules that allow the process access. Taking care not to
break your system we can demonstrate SELinux at work.
