SUID
Used on programs to run as the user owner during execution

SGID
On directories, new files are assigned the group owner from the directory

Sticky Bit
With this set users can only delete files they own from shared directories



It is useful to be able to list files with certain permission set and helps us with security audit. For
the moment we will become used to setting the permissions and list the top-level directory.
