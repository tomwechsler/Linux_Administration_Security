What are the Linux capabilities anyway?

Well, the answer is pretty simple - A granular set of permissions assigned to a running program or 
thread or even a program file by root user to allow process use privileged (system-level tasks) 
like killing process owned by different users from a shell of a low privileged user. 
Each capability provides one or more sets of related privileges to the process.
