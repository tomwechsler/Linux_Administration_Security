The local user account database is the file /etc/passwd. This is a text file accessible by all
users. It is not usual to store passwords in this file anymore. The command getent can be
used to display or search the database.

Typically, the command cut is used to filter the fields; however, we may also need to use grep
to search for a specific user. Using awk we can cover both with the one command.
