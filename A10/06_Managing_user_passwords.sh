Commonly, the command passwd is used to set the password. If you use both Debian and
RedHat based systems, the chpasswd command is useful for non-interactive password setting.
The passwd command is also useful for locking a users account, perhaps while they are on
vacation. Use -l to lock, -S to check status and -u to unlock.

Having modified the login.defs, this will work for standard interactive users. For systems
accounts we dont want the password to expire using the useradd option -r we by-pass the
restrictions in login.defs. We can use chage to set explicit information for any account.
