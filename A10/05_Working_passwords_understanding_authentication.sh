#The salt and password combined = hash
openssl passwd -6 -salt xda6csfZi9xqDYkX P@ssw0rd

#Change one character and we get a complete new hash
openssl passwd -6 -salt xda6csfZi9xqDYkX P@ssword

openssl passwd -6 P@ssword

openssl passwd -6 P@ssword




Passwords are stored within the second field of the shadow file. The entry itself is broken down
3 separate entities: the algorithm, the SALT and the password hash.

We can quickli create a user account setting its password. RedHat based systems have the
option --stdin but Debian based systems do not. We can show the authentication process by
using the openssl command
